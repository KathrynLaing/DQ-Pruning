# Experiment
As detailed in our paper, ARXIV LINK, we conducted an experiment to compare the performance of several dominance testing functions for CP-Nets.
Each dominance testing function answers dominance queries by building the associated search tree.
To improve efficiency, a pruning method is used to prune certain branches of this tree as it is constructed.
In order to fully specify how a dominance testing function works, one must also specify the method of leaf prioritisation used (when building up the tree).
Which pruning method and prioritisation technique combinations we tested are given below.
The performance of a dominance testing function on a given query is measured both by outcomes traversed and time elapsed.
For full details of this terminology, we refer you to section 6 of the paper.

Given *n* (number of variables in the CP-net), each dominance testing function was tested on the same set of 1000 dominance queries.
These queries were randomly generated by generating 100 CP-nets and then for each, 10 queries were randomly generated.

This was done twice. First, for the case of binary CP-nets, for *n*=3-10.
Second, for the case of multivalued CP-nets, for *n*=3-8. By multivalued CP-nets, we mean that the variables could have domain size between 2-5.

In this repository, we provide the CP-net generator code we used. We also provide the code for each of the dominance testing functions.
These are all provided as R scripts and allow you to repeat these experiments with different values of *n*.
You may also vary the values of the maximum possible size of variable domain and the maximum number of parents a variable can have (we left this as *(n-1)* in our experiments).
We also provide the raw results of our experiments, as well as the generated graphs of the average performance of the different functions.
